The rhythms of the seasons, accentuated by the Honeydays, or other customs... Produces a familiar sway that acts as a point of reference, no? For our progress... For our growth... Mmmh. They give the structure to our lives upon which change can grow! Our daily, our monthly, our yearly routines establish themselves like vines on that lattice. So would we dare shake it up!? (Cough) Dare to exchange these NOW? And risk losing that rhythm? Might knock our petals off! Before you know it, you'll be just like me. Lost in a timeless, sleepy fog. No clue what month it is. ... Hmm, but you do have a point, dear. The rhythm's already lost! Perhaps we've already moved on to this, mmm, post-annular era. Perhaps the years themselves are getting longer... Or maybe tradition was alawys a silly concept. A cage more than a stage. I mean, I've always been an innovator. A trailblaizer.  Always tried to switch things up - to never settle into a groove.

Probably before you were born, you do look so young. With that on the tree, you'll receive these boosts: +25% Convert Rate +25% Capacity in the Stump Field And +5% from Bee Abilities! Don't think they give these out anymore. The Memory Match Committee isn't what it used to be. People don't need to practice to keep their memory sharp when they've got smartphones.
