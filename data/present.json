I mean, I can't keep up with that. ... Snow everywhere, like frosting on our Beesmas cake! Decorated with all those delightful contraptions this year. Like that wreath. Hehehh, Black Bear, bless his heart. Look at that Honey Wreath. I won't say more... Oh but Mother Bear's Gingerbread House! Oh, I like that one. ...(she's staring into the distance)... Is that a ? Or... Hmm. I'm tired of counting. I'm bored now. Why bother with something so mundane, in the most exciting time of the year! Bee Bear, oh that precious fool. Don't tell him I called him a fool.

How did we even make it through the winters before him? Well, I mean, I do remember... It wasn't so bad. We just celebrated, we just didn't focus so much on the bees. Not that you bees don't deserve it! Bee Bear is completely right about that. We celebrated the passing of the year in a more general sense. We still ate a lot of the same food, did similar customs, it just felt a little more... off the cusp. We still put ornaments on a tree, you see, we just didn't have a special name for it. Or did we? Hmmm... Was it... Oh, like I'll ever remember. Mother always had a tree, and we dolled it up for winter. Left it up much longer than we probably should have, we were never... punctual. But it was always so, so full of ornaments! Everyone was jealous of our tree. Perhaps the only time our hoarding tendencies were a source of envy. Hah! And things really took off as Beesmas became more and more of a thing. Mother couldn't help herself, any time she saw an ornament on sale. Mmhmm. And some of those - completely unnecessary, Mother. The only thing more imposing than our tree was the size of our debt. How did we even get approved for so many credit cards? Yaach... But it was worth it. You can't put a price on Beesmas Magic. Well, you can, sort of. Just take a look on Bee Bear's Catalog. But you understand what I mean. Those debts are long gone, and here I am countless years later and still reminiscing about our trees. Mother's taste for ornaments - they were well considered. ...(she's staring off into the distance)... ...31... Or was it? Drats. I've lost count again. I can't help myself!

Or... Hmm. I'm tired of counting. I'm bored now. Why bother with something so mundane, in the most exciting time of the year! Bee Bear, oh that precious fool. Don't tell him I called him a fool.

How did we even make it through the winters before him? Well, I mean, I do remember... It wasn't so bad. We just celebrated, we just didn't focus so much on the bees. Not that you bees don't deserve it! Bee Bear is completely right about that. We celebrated the passing of the year in a more general sense. We still ate a lot of the same food, did similar customs, it just felt a little more... off the cusp. We still put ornaments on a tree, you see, we just didn't have a special name for it. Or did we? Hmmm... Was it... Oh, like I'll ever remember. Mother always had a tree, and we dolled it up for winter. Left it up much longer than we probably should have, we were never... punctual. But it was always so, so full of ornaments! Everyone was jealous of our tree. Perhaps the only time our hoarding tendencies were a source of envy. Hah! And things really took off as Beesmas became more and more of a thing. Mother couldn't help herself, any time she saw an ornament on sale. Mmhmm. And some of those - completely unnecessary, Mother. The only thing more imposing than our tree was the size of our debt. How did we even get approved for so many credit cards? Yaach... But it was worth it. You can't put a price on Beesmas Magic. Well, you can, sort of. Just take a look on Bee Bear's Catalog. But you understand what I mean. Those debts are long gone, and here I am countless years later and still reminiscing about our trees.

Bee Swarm Simulator was involved in their 2018 Beesmas event. After that, it sort of became part of the Bee Swarm Sim lore too. It's convenient, because it references a real holiday without being too specific. For example, it doesn't matter if we celebrate Beesmas after the real Christmas. I mean, whose to say Beesmas doesn't actually take place in February, right? Hmm... Yeah OK... Anyways, what did you and Bee Bear bring me this year? ...(krumple krumple)... Wow!

I mean, I can't keep up with that. ... Snow everywhere, like frosting on our Beesmas cake! Decorated with all those delightful contraptions this year. Like that wreath. Hehehh, Black Bear, bless his heart. Look at that Honey Wreath. I won't say more... Oh but Mother Bear's Gingerbread House! Oh, I like that one. ...(she's staring into the distance)... Is that a ? Or... Hmm. I'm tired of counting. I'm bored now. Why bother with something so mundane, in the most exciting time of the year! Bee Bear, oh that precious fool. Don't tell him I called him a fool. Not that he would mind. To think that we mere mortal bears could offend a honeyday deity. Anyways, that sweet, jovial bear, he brightens up the entire mountain in the darkest days of the year. How did we even make it through the winters before him? Well, I mean, I do remember... It wasn't so bad. We just celebrated, we just didn't focus so much on the bees. Not that you bees don't deserve it! Bee Bear is completely right about that. We celebrated the passing of the year in a more general sense. We still ate a lot of the same food, did similar customs, it just felt a little more... off the cusp. We still put ornaments on a tree, you see, we just didn't have a special name for it. Or did we? Hmmm... Was it... Oh, like I'll ever remember. Mother always had a tree, and we dolled it up for winter. Left it up much longer than we probably should have, we were never... punctual. But it was always so, so full of ornaments! Everyone was jealous of our tree. Perhaps the only time our hoarding tendencies were a source of envy. Hah! And things really took off as Beesmas became more and more of a thing. Mother couldn't help herself, any time she saw an ornament on sale. Mmhmm. And some of those - completely unnecessary, Mother. The only thing more imposing than our tree was the size of our debt. How did we even get approved for so many credit cards? Yaach... But it was worth it. You can't put a price on Beesmas Magic. Well, you can, sort of. Just take a look on Bee Bear's Catalog. But you understand what I mean. Those debts are long gone, and here I am countless years later and still reminiscing about our trees. Mother's taste for ornaments - they were well considered. ...(she's staring off into the distance)... ...31... Or was it? Drats. I've lost count again. I can't help myself!

A gift! Will you open it for Spirit Bear? My hands are full, you know. And sore. ...(You open the present for Spirit Bear)... ...(krumple krumple)... Oh no! Oh no no no! This - this is just too much! It's a Baby  Ornament! From the outer space show! Everyone's favorite little green alien, the tiny space wizard, in a replica of his floating crib. It's so cute I could cry! Thank you, dear, thank you! This is going on the top of my tree next year, the very top is where little  belongs. ... ..(she's staring off into the distance)... Mmhmm, the very top. ... OK, goodbye now. ... Oh! YOUR gift! Yes yes I have one for you! A few things, actually. Including my ! With that on the tree, well, I don't quite recall what it does. You can check the tree yourself.

What did he whip up this time? Oooh yeahh! A 12 pack of frozen truffle and sharp cheddar mac-and-cheese meals! I'll heat some up right now, you and your bees have to try this. It's my favorite. ...(beep beep)... ...(szzzzzzzzzzz)... ...(DING)... Mmmmm, delicious! Everyone's got their quirks, you know. At the end of the day, Bee Bear is still a nice guy.

I'm already late... It was only recently that I realized I've been twisting this lid the wrong way for months. So here we are, hope this cuts it for now. I'll need to do something again next week to close out the holidays.\n-Present Given-\nOoooo I wonder what this could be! lol Wow! A hastily drawn icon of a Christmas present! Thanks a lot.
