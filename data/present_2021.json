Oh, it's quite hypnotic! I keep losing count because, well, it's like counting sheep. At one point, though, I counted. What was it... Over 50 ? I lost count that time because of a Snow Storm. I mean, I can't keep up with that. ... Snow everywhere, like frosting on our Beesmas cake! Decorated with all those delightful contraptions this year. Like that wreath. Hehehh, Black Bear, bless his heart. Look at that Honey Wreath. I won't say more... Oh but Mother Bear's Gingerbread House! Oh, I like that one. ...(she's staring into the distance)... Is that a ? Or... Hmm. I'm tired of counting. I'm bored now. Why bother with something so mundane, in the most exciting time of the year! Bee Bear, oh that precious fool. Don't tell him I called him a fool. Not that he would mind. To think that we mere mortal bears could offend a honeyday deity. Anyways, that sweet, jovial bear, he brightens up the entire mountain in the darkest days of the year. How did we even make it through the winters before him? Well, I mean, I do remember... It wasn't so bad. We just celebrated, we just didn't focus so much on the bees. Not that you bees don't deserve it! Bee Bear is completely right about that. We celebrated the passing of the year in a more general sense. We still ate a lot of the same food, did similar customs, it just felt a little more... off the cusp. We still put ornaments on a tree, you see, we just didn't have a special name for it. Or did we? Hmmm... Was it... Oh, like I'll ever remember. Mother always had a tree, and we dolled it up for winter. Left it up much longer than we probably should have, we were never... punctual. But it was always so, so full of ornaments! Everyone was jealous of our tree. Perhaps the only time our hoarding tendencies were a source of envy. Hah! And things really took off as Beesmas became more and more of a thing. Mother couldn't help herself, any time she saw an ornament on sale. Mmhmm. And some of those - completely unnecessary, Mother. The only thing more imposing than our tree was the size of our debt. How did we even get approved for so many credit cards? Yaach... But it was worth it. You can't put a price on Beesmas Magic. Well, you can, sort of. Just take a look on Bee Bear's Catalog. But you understand what I mean. Those debts are long gone, and here I am countless years later and still reminiscing about our trees. Mother's taste for ornaments - they were well considered. ...(she's staring off into the distance)... ...32... Or was it? Drats. I've lost count again. I can't help myself! I just see the  and I just start... But it's too hard! And it's boring. Let's do something else. What have you come to see me about, anyhow, dear? What's that you're holding - it's for me? Oh! A gift! Will you open it for Spirit Bear? My hands are full, you know. And sore. ...(You open the present for Spirit Bear)... ...(krumple krumple)... Oh no! Oh no no no! This - this is just too much! It's a... picture frame? With no picture. ... A what now? It's electronic? Oh dear you know I'm no good with electronics. Is this a television? No? What? A digital picture frame? The only digits I understand are the 10 on my paws, dear. I appreciate it, I do! I'll try my best to get some use out of it. I could just, tape a photo on it. Nooo... I'll do it. I'll figure it out.
