If you grew up with up my family, you'd be sick of it too. Bee Bear's not magical. He's a polar bear in a bee suit. But he brings me something delicious every year, so I can't complain. What did he whip up this time? Oooh yeahh! A 12 pack of frozen truffle and sharp cheddar mac-and-cheese meals! I'll heat some up right now, you and your bees have to try this. It's my favorite. ...(beep beep)... ...(szzzzzzzzzzz)... ...(DING)... Mmmmm, delicious! Everyone's got their quirks, you know. At the end of the day, Bee Bear is still a nice guy. Here, I've prepared something special for you too. Happy Honeydays!"

A friend of mine on Roblox named Younite messaged me a few weeks ago, His friend Mah_Bucket has apparently been hosting a bee-themed Christmas event on Roblox for years! I couldn't say no! Seriously, it's called \"Beesmas\" and just look at this game. And when they showed me Bubble Bee Man I was in awe. But I don't have a good track record with getting out fast updates... I'm already late... It was only recently that I realized I've been twisting this lid the wrong way for months. So here we are, hope this cuts it for now. I'll need to do something again next week to close out the holidays.\n-Present Given-\nOoooo I wonder what this could be! lol Wow! A hastily drawn icon of a Christmas present! Thanks a lot. But you know what I really want? To go on vacation in January and not think about bees for a whole month. I\u2019ve got some more lid-related things to attend to first. Here\u2019s your secret reward for gifting a  to me!\""

So what'd you get me?? ... RIGHT ON! It's a strawberry scented air freshener! The kind you hang on the reer  view mirror of a car. I don't have a car, and I can't smell it very well out here...

That's what gives us our edge.\n-Present Given-\nHah hah, of course you'd do this. Surprise me with a Present out of the blue! You're a stand up beekeeper, you know that? Let me just open this thing up... ...(krumple krumple)... Nice! Some tickets to see the Blue Bee Group in Vegas. Not sure how I'll get there or when I'll find the time to go, But it doesn't look like they expire. Now's your turn! A little something from all us Blue Bees at the HQ."

Very cool. Let me set this up. ... Now let's give it a whirl."
